			<article id="about">
				<h2 class="major">About Us</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/Royal_Blue2.png" alt="Image of June Johnson" /></span>
				<p>Born in Memphis, Tennesee during the height of the seventies and the greatest decade for Black Soul, June is an empath and counselor. As a licensed attorney in three states, June has been practicing all manner of law since 2006. With legal
					experience ranging from an inner city Prosecutor, to a solo- practitioner, and an in-court mediator, she has heard just about every side of every argument imaginable. However, It's June's unique position as an ordained minister in the Baptist
					tradition that really attracts balance and compassion to her sage advice. Getting people out of tough situations with thoughtfully kind, yet; stern words are her super-power, along with naming obscure 90s R&B groups. She is a force of nature
					and is mostly on your side!</p>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/MiniHicks.jpeg" alt="Image of Minisha Hicks" /></span>
				<p>Minisha is a mid-western girl born in the Nati (so you know you can't touch my chili game) who did a stint in the south and made her home on the east coast. She is a proud graduate of Tennessee State University, home of the often imitated,
					never duplicated Aristocrat of Bands, and The Mecca, Howard University. HU...You Know!!! She is an attorney by training, but currently leads a team of 15 or so...um...very...interestinggggg people in federal government. So, to say the least,
					she is well versed in dealing with challenging people and situations. Born in the sign of the Virtuous Virgo, her conflict resolution style begins with analyzing her way to the heart of the issue. This direct communicator, with a quick wit and
					a sassy style, will leave you in stitches while providing clear and wise counsel with a smile. </p>
